## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting the future market value of professional football players** based on their physical attributes, technical skills, club affiliation, and historical performance data.

By using FIFA datasets from 2015 to 2023, we developed a machine learning pipeline that analyzes player features and forecasts their valuation **one year** and **two years** into the future.

## üéØ Objective

- Build a predictive system for estimating **players' future market value**.
- Analyze player data based on physical, technical, and club-related features.
- Compare multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing approach for valuation forecasting.

## üìä Key Components

### üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**:  
  [EA Sports FC 24 Complete Player Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/ea-sports-fc-24-complete-player-dataset)

- **Data Range**:  
  Seasons 2015‚Äì2023.

- **Features Used**:  
  - Physical attributes: Age, Height, Weight
  - Performance skills: Pace, Passing, Shooting, Ball Control
  - Club information: Club rating, League prestige
  - Personal features: Nationality, Position, Work Rate
  - Special skills: Count of unique traits (e.g., flair, injury resistance)

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Interaction terms (e.g., Age √ó Stamina)
  - Polynomial features (e.g., Squared values for non-linear relations)
  - Categorical encoding
  - Aggregated special attributes

---

## üî• Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
  - Applied forward feature selection to optimize model simplicity and avoid overfitting.
  - Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error and Confidence Intervals.

- **Lasso Regression**
  - Used to perform feature selection automatically by applying L1 regularization.
  - Focused on retaining only the most impactful features for prediction.

- **Random Forest Regression**
  - Ensemble model leveraging multiple decision trees.
  - Ranked feature importance and improved generalization across noisy datasets.

---

## üìà Evaluation

- Predicting **1-year** and **2-year** market value increases.
- Separate models trained for different player roles:
  - Goalkeepers
  - Defenders (Center Backs, Fullbacks)
  - Midfielders (Defensive and Attacking)
  - Strikers

- Metrics Analyzed:
  - Mean and Median residuals (prediction errors)
  - Confidence intervals
  - Sharpe and Sortino Ratios (for investment-style player selection)

- **Bonus Strategy**:
  - Invest in players predicted to increase value by 1.5√ó within a year.
  - Based on Linear Regression forecasts and top 9 selected features.

- Best performance was achieved with **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression with feature selection**, depending on the player group.
